# Compiled game discs for the Elite Compendium

This folder contains the double-sided DSD disc image for the Elite Compendium, as produced by the build process. This DSD image can be loaded into an emulator like JSBeeb or BeebEm, or into a real BBC Micro using a device like a Gotek.

It also contains the exact same disc image, but split into two single-sided SSD disc images, one for drive 0 and another for drive 2. These can be used in systems that do not support DSD images, like the Turbo MMC SD card expansion.

Right on, Commanders!
